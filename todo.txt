AFTER DEMO
- Dirichlet distribution for data (alpha = infinite -> Homogeneous, alpha = 0, Completely Non-IID)
(T.M.H. Hsu, et al., 2019)

- Make sure there is not data leakage. Weird results when nodes drop and join again.

Front End:
1. Topology for Tree
2. Integration for model input
3. W&B Experiment Log


Back End:

1. Centralized distribution
    - need schedule, ip mappings sent from a central place to clients

2. Round delay
    - need a good way of measuring round delay

3. Logging
    - move server and client code to same folder to test logging

4. Strategies
    - Add in strategies other than FedAvg
    - fit aggregate and eval aggregate for metrics

5. Chunking
    - inhomogenous chunk sizes
