AFTER DEMO
- Dirichlet distribution for data (alpha = infinite -> Homogeneous, alpha = 0, Completely Non-IID)
(T.M.H. Hsu, et al., 2019)

- Make sure there is not data leakage. Weird results when nodes drop and join again.

Front End:
1. Topology for Tree
2. Integration for model input
3. W&B Experiment Log


Back End:
1. Connect logging to API (maybe revisit measurement of round delay)
2. Add in networking support for chunking
3. Add in strategies other than FedAvg
4. Fix node IP mappings
